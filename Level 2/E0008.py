# CHALLENGE 1: Write a function that takes in two integers and
#              multiplies them together then returns the result.
def multi(x,y):
  return x * y;
# CHALLENGE 2: Run the function from CHALLENGE 1, passing in the
#              integers 99 and 52 and print the result.
print(multi(99,52))
# CHALLENGE 3: Write a function that takes two integers and prints
#              the string "I am X ft Y inches tall", replacing the
#              X and Y with the numbers passed into the function.
def s(x,y):
	return print("I am {} ft {} inches tall".format(x,y))
# CHALLENGE 4: Run the function from CHALLENGE 3, passing in 6 and 2
#              as the parameters.
s(6,2)
